\title{Mutual information of two splits}
\usage{
SplitMutualInformation(n, A1, A2 = A1)

SplitVariationOfInformation(n, A1, A2 = A1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer specifying the number of terminals.}

\item{A1, A2}{Integers specifying the number of taxa in _A1_ and _A2_, 
once the splits have been arranged such that _A1_ overlaps with _A2_.}
}
\value{
`SplitMutualInformation` returns the information that two splits 
have in common, in bits.

`SplitVariationOfInformation` returns the variation of information (Meila 2007)
 between the two splits, a measure of their difference, in bits.
}
\description{
Reports the mutual phylogenetic information, or variation of phylogenetic
information, of two splits.
}
\details{
The mutual phylogenetic information corresponds to the entropy of the subset
of trees consistent with both splits; two splits that are consistent with a 
smaller number of trees will have a higher mutual information content.

Split 1 divides `n` terminals into two partitions, _A1_ and _B1_.
Split 2 divides the same terminals into the partitions _A2_ and _B2_.

Partitions must be named such that _A1_ overlaps with _A2_: that is to say,
all taxa in _A1_ are also in _A2_, or _vice versa_.  Thus, all taxa in 
the smaller of _A1_ and _A2_ also occur in the larger.
