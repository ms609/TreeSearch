\title{Number of tree labellings with \emph{k} steps}
\usage{
BinaryLabellings(tips, steps, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tips}{Integer giving number of leaves; or tree whose leaves will be
counted with \code{\link[TreeTools:NTip]{TreeTools::NTip()}}.}

\item{steps}{Integer giving number of parsimony steps.}

\item{log}{Logical or numeric; if \code{TRUE}, results will be log transformed
in base $e$; if numeric, in base \code{log}.}
}
\value{
The number of possible binary leaf labellings.
}
\description{
Number of ways to assign labels \code{0} and \code{1} to leaves of a rooted binary tree
such that the tree has Fitch parsimony length \code{k}.
As only two labels are available, this is independent of tree shape.
