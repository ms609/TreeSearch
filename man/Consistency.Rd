\title{Consistency / retention 'indices'}
\usage{
Consistency(dataset, tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A phylogenetic data matrix of class \code{\link[phangorn]{phyDat}},
whose names correspond to the labels of any accompanying tree.}

\item{tree}{A tree of class \code{\link{phylo}}.}
}
\value{
\code{Consistency()} returns a named vector specifying the consistency index (ci),
retention index (ri), and rescalced consistency index (rc).
}
\description{
\code{Consistency()} calculates the so-called consistency and retention 'indices'
for each character in a dataset, given a bifurcating tree.
Although there is not a straightforward interpretation of these indices,
they are sometimes taken as an indicator of the fit of a character to a
tree.  Values correlate with the number of species sampled and the
distribution of taxa between character states, so are not strictly comparable
between characters in which these factors differ.
