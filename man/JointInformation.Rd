\title{Joint Information of two splits}
\usage{
JointInformation(n, A1, A2 = A1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of terminals}

\item{A1}{Number of terminals on overlapping side of each split.}

\item{A2}{Number of terminals on overlapping side of each split.}
}
\description{
Because some information is common to both splits (`MutualInformation`),
the joint information of two splits will be less than the sum of the
information of the splits taken separately -- unless the splits are
contradictory.
