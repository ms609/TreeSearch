\title{Joint Information of two splits}
\usage{
JointInformation(A1A2, A1B2, B1A2, B1B2)
}
\arguments{
\item{A1A2, A1B2, B1A2, B1B2}{Number of taxa in splits A1 and A2 (etc.)}
}
\description{
Because some information is common to both splits (`SplitMutualInformation`),
the joint information of two splits will be less than the sum of the
information of the splits taken separately -- unless the splits are
contradictory.
}
\details{
Split Y1 is defined as dividing taxa into the two sets A1 and B1,
and Y2=A2:B2.
