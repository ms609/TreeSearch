\title{Frequency of most common contradictory split}
\usage{
MostContradictedFreq(tree, forest)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A tree of class \code{\link[ape:read.tree]{phylo}}.}

\item{forest}{a list of trees of class \code{phylo}, or a \code{multiPhylo} object;
or a \code{Splits} object.}
}
\value{
\code{MostContradictedFreq()} returns, for each split in \code{tree},
the number of times that its most common contradictory split occurs in
\code{forest}.
}
\description{
\code{MostContradictedFreq()} counts the occurrences of the single split that most
frequently contradicts each split in \code{tree}.

This function was written during a code sprint: its documentation and test
cases have not yet been carefully scrutinized, and its implementation may
change without notice.
Please alert the maintainer to any issues you encounter.
}
\details{
\insertCite{Goloboff2003;textual}{TreeSearch} propose comparing the frequency
of a split in a resampled population with the frequency of the most common
contradictory split.  This measure contributes to the "groups present /
contradicted" score.

\code{PresCont()} calculates the "groups present / contradicted" score.
