\usage{
PresCont(
  tree,
  forest,
  plot = TRUE,
  add = FALSE,
  adj = 0,
  col = NULL,
  frame = "none",
  pos = 2L,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A tree of class \code{\link[ape:read.tree]{phylo}}.}

\item{forest}{a list of trees of class \code{phylo}, or a \code{multiPhylo} object;
or a \code{Splits} object.}

\item{plot}{Logical specifying whether to plot results; if \code{FALSE},
returns blank labels for nodes near the root that do not correspond to a
unique split.}

\item{add}{Logical specifying whether to add the labels to an existing
plot.}

\item{adj, col, frame, pos, \dots}{Parameters to pass to \code{nodelabels()}.}
}
\value{
\code{PresCont()}  returns a character vector that labels the nodes
in \code{tree} in sequence, suitable for passing to \code{nodelabels()} or
\code{tree$node.label}.
If \code{plot = TRUE}, it also plots \code{tree}, with splits labelled by their
groups present / contradicted score.

\description{
Implements the Groups Present / Contradicted (\acronym{GC}) measure
\insertCite{Goloboff2003}{TreeSearch}.

This function was written during a code sprint: its documentation and test
cases have not yet been carefully scrutinized, and its implementation may
change without notice.
Please alert the maintainer to any issues you encounter.

\details{
The GC score ranges from -1 to 1, and is intended as an alternative
to bootstrap or jackknife support values.

The GC score counts the number of trees in \code{forest} that include a given
split, and subtracts the number of times that the \emph{most frequent}
contradictory split occurs.  This value is then divided by the number of
trees in \code{forest}.

A score of 1 denotes that every tree in a forest (typically of bootstrap
or jackknife replicates) contains the split in question.
A score of -1 denotes that a specific contradictory split occurs in
every tree in \code{forest}.
A score of zero indicates no support: i.e. that the split exhibits no more
support than its most common contradictory split.

The most frequent contradictory split is used to discriminate between
a scenario where a given split enjoys much more support than any other
alternative (even if many alternatives exist, each with low support),
and a scenario where the chosen split is scarcely any better supported than
a competing alternative.  The split is considered better supported than
the latter, where the runner-up may become preferred with a modest change to
the underlying dataset.

\examples{
library("TreeTools", quietly = TRUE) # for as.phylo

# jackTrees will usually be generated with Jackknife() or Resample(),
# but for simplicity:
jackTrees <- as.phylo(1:100, 8)

tree <- as.phylo(0, 8)
PresCont(tree, jackTrees)

tree$node.label <- PresCont(tree, jackTrees, plot = FALSE)

# Write the labelled tree to screen
ape::write.tree(tree)

# Write labelled trees to a nexus file:
# write.nexus(tree, file = filename)

# Compute the measure for further analysis
gpc <- (SplitFrequency(tree, jackTrees) -
  MostContradictedFreq(tree, jackTrees)) / length(jackTrees)
gpc

\code{\link[TreeTools]{SplitFrequency}()} and \code{\link[=MostContradictedFreq]{MostContradictedFreq()}} will compute the number
of trees that contain the split, and the frequency of the most contradicted
split, respectively.
