\title{Probability of matching this well}
\usage{
AnySizeSplitMatchProbability(split1, split2)
}
\arguments{
\item{split1, split2}{Logical vectors listing terminals in same order, such that
each terminal is identified as a member of the ingroup (`TRUE`) or outgroup 
(`FALSE`) of the respective bipartition split.}
}
\value{
The proportion of permissable informative splits 
splitting the terminals into bipartitions of the sizes given,
 that match as well as `split1` and `split2` do.
}
\description{
Probability that two random splits of the sizes provided will be at least
as similar as the two specified.
