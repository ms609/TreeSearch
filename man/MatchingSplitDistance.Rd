\usage{
MatchingSplitDistance(tree1, tree2, normalize = TRUE,
  reportMatching = FALSE)

MatchingSplitDistanceSplits(splits1, splits2, normalize = TRUE,
  reportMatching = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree1}{Trees of class \code{phylo}, with tips labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{tree2}{Trees of class \code{phylo}, with tips labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{normalize}{Logical (default = \code{TRUE}) specifying whether to re-scale
results onto a scale of zero to one, where one represents the total
information content of two independent trees of the given size and topology.}

\item{reportMatching}{Logical specifying whether to return the clade
matchings as an attribute of the score.}

\item{splits1}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a terminal,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a bipartition split, such that
each terminal is identified as a member of the ingroup (\code{TRUE}) or outgroup
(\code{FALSE}) of the respective bipartition split.}

\item{splits2}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a terminal,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a bipartition split, such that
each terminal is identified as a member of the ingroup (\code{TRUE}) or outgroup
(\code{FALSE}) of the respective bipartition split.}
