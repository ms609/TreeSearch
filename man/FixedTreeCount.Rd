\title{Number of leaf labellings producing given tree lengths}
\usage{
FixedTreeCount(tree, tokens, steps = -1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A binary tree of class phylo}

\item{tokens}{Integer vector: Occurrences of each token}

\item{steps}{Integer vector: maximum number of steps to compute.
A negative value computes all possible step counts.

Given a tree, how many distinct leaf labellings produce a tree length of
$k$ under Fitch parsimony?
The number of leaves exhibiting each character state is given by \code{tokens}.}
}
\value{
\code{FixedTreeCount()} returns a vector of names \code{0}...\code{maxSteps},
where each entry lists the natural logarithm of the number of distinct
labellings that produce that Fitch length.
}
\description{
Number of leaf labellings producing given tree lengths
}
\examples{
tree <- TreeTools::BalancedTree(7)
tokens <- c(2, 3, 2) # e.g. 0 0 1 1 1 2 2
FixedTreeCount(tree, 2:4, tokens)

Note: setting `Inf` for steps will give all possible outcomes.
Setting a lower value will allow some recursions to terminate early,
potentially improving runtime - but probably not by much.
