\title{Number of trees with \emph{m} steps}
\usage{
Carter1(m, a, b)

Log2Carter1(m, a, b)

LogCarter1(m, a, b)

MaddisonSlatkin(steps, states)
}
\arguments{
\item{m, steps}{Number of steps.}

\item{a, b}{Number of leaves labelled \code{0} and \code{1}.}

\item{states}{Number of leaves labelled with each possible state.
States are presented in binary fashion.  The first entry of the vector
corresponds to state \code{1} (binary \code{001}),
the second to state \code{2} (binary \code{010}),
and the third to the ambiguous state \code{01} (binary \code{011}).}

\description{
Functions to compute the number of trees with a given parsimony score.
}
\details{
\code{Carter1()} calculates the number of trees in which Fitch parsimony will
reconstruct  \emph{m} steps, where \emph{a} leaves are labelled with one state,
and \emph{b} leaves are labelled with a second state, using theorem 1 of
\insertCite{Carter1990;textual}{TreeTools}

\code{MaddisonSlatkin()} generalises this result to characters with multiple
steps using the recursive approach of
\insertCite{Maddison1991;textual}{TreeSearch}.
}
\examples{
# The character `0 0 0 1 1 1`
Carter1(1, 3, 3) # Exactly one step
Carter1(2, 3, 3) # Two steps (one extra step)

# Number of trees that the character can map onto with exactly _m_ steps
# if non-parsimonious reconstructions are permitted:
cumsum(sapply(1:3, Carter1, 3, 3))

# Three steps allow the character to map onto any of the 105 six-leaf trees.
Carter1(3, 3, 3)
NUnrooted(3 + 3)

# Number of trees with 2 steps for character 0011122
MaddisonSlatkin(2, c("0" = 2, "1" = 3, "01" = 0, "2" = 2)) * NUnrooted(7)
