\title{Information required to encode a character using a Fitch-like algorithm}
\usage{
FitchInfo(tree, dataset)
}
\description{
Given a tree, the amount of information required to encode a character is
determined by the number of extra steps the character implies on a tree.
}
\details{
If there are \eqn{n} ways to produce the observed distribution of tokens with
\eqn{s} extra steps, then the minimum encoding length of the observed
distribution (given the number of states observed, the number of steps, and
the tree) is \eqn{n\log{n}}.

This encoding captures how closely a character constrains a tree, which is
not quite what we are interested in: there are many more trees on which
a character fits rather poorly than on which it fits maximally poorly.

Hence we use a cumulative information measure, asking instead how many trees
require \emph{at most} as many steps as the number that are observed.
This fits with the possibility that a parsimonious distribution may arise
through multiple steps, even if such steps would not be distinguished
by a parsimonious reconstruction.

This value is most readily interpreted when normalized against the expected
entropy of a random shuffling of states.

\section{Quirks}{

Characters that are not parsimony informative (i.e. singletons) contain no
phylogenetic information, so contribute zero to both numerator
and denominator.  If no character is parsimony informative, we define the
return value as 1.
