\title{Variation of information between two trees}
\usage{
VariationOfInfo(tree1, tree2, reportMatching = FALSE)

VariationOfSplitInfo(splits1, splits2, reportMatching = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree1}{Trees of class `phylo`, with tips labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{tree2}{Trees of class `phylo`, with tips labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{reportMatching}{Logical specifying whether to return the clade
matchings as an attribute of the score.}

\item{splits1, splits2}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a terminal,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a bipartition split, such that
each terminal is identified as a member of the ingroup (`TRUE`) or outgroup 
(`FALSE`) of the respective bipartition split.}
