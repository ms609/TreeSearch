\title{Exact Distribution of Parsimony Score on a Tree (I.I.D. Model)}
\usage{
active_parsimony_dist(tree, state_probs, steps)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object (list with edge matrix).}

\item{state_probs}{A numeric vector of probabilities for each state (0..r-1).
Must sum to 1. Length determines r.}

\item{steps}{The maximum cost k to compute (returns 0..k).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of log-probabilities for steps 0 to k.
}
\description{
Computes the log-probability that a character generated by independent
resampling of leaf states has a parsimony length L(T) = k.
}
