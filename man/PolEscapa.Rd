\title{Contribution of character to leaf instability}
\usage{
PolEscapa(trees, char, concavity = Inf, applicability = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{List of trees of class \code{phylo}, or \code{multiPhylo} object.}

\item{char}{\code{phyDat} object containing a single character.}

\item{concavity}{Determines the degree to which extra steps beyond the first
are penalized.  Specify a numeric value to use implied weighting
\insertCite{Goloboff1993}{TreeSearch}; \code{concavity} specifies \emph{k} in
\emph{k} / \emph{e} + \emph{k}. A value of 10 is recommended;
TNT sets a default of 3, but this is too low in some circumstances
\insertCite{Goloboff2018,Smith2019}{TreeSearch}.
Better still explore the sensitivity of results under a range of
concavity values, e.g. \code{k = 2 ^ (1:7)}.
Specify \code{Inf} to weight each additional step equally.
Specify \code{'profile'} to employ profile parsimony \insertCite{Faith2001}{TreeSearch}.}
}
\value{
\code{PolEscapa()} returns a named numeric vector listing the mean
absolute change to tree length resulting if the character were coded
ambiguous for each leaf in turn, under the specified concavity constant.
}
\description{
Would tree length change if a character was coded as ambiguous for each
leaf \insertRef{Pol2009}{TreeSearch}?
}
\details{
When inapplicable tokens are present in a character, the applicability of
each coding is maintained: i.e. a leaf coded with an applicable token is
never allowed to take an inapplicable value; and an inapplicable token
remains inapplicable.
