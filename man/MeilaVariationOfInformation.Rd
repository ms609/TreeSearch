\title{Use Variation of Information to compare partitions as clusterings}
\usage{
MeilaVariationOfInformation(split1, split2)
}
\arguments{
\item{split1, split2}{Logical vectors listing terminals in same order, such that
each terminal is identified as a member of the ingroup (`TRUE`) or outgroup 
(`FALSE`) of the respective bipartition split.}
}
\value{
Variation of information, measured in bits.
}
\description{
Compare a pair of splits solely as clusterings of taxa, disregarding their
phlogenetic information, using the information based distance proposed
by Meila (2007).
}
\examples{
  # Maximum variation = information content of each split separately
  MeilaVariationOfInformation(c(T,T,T,F,F,F), c(T,T,T,T,T,T))
  Entropy(c(3, 3) / 6) + Entropy(c(0, 6) / 6)
  
  # Minimum variation = 0
  MeilaVariationOfInformation(c(T,T,T,F,F,F), c(T,T,T,F,F,F))
  
  # Not always possible for two evenly-sized splits to reach maximum
  variation of information
  Entropy(c(3, 3) / 6) * 2  # = 2
  MeilaVariationOfInformation(c(T,T,T,F,F,F), c(T,F,T,F,T,F)) # < 2
  
  # Phylogenetically uninformative groupings contain partitioning information
  Entropy(c(1, 5) / 6)
  MeilaVariationOfInformation(c(F,T,T,T,T,T), c(T,T,T,T,T,F))
