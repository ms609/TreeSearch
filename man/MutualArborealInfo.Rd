}
\arguments{
\item{tree1, tree2}{Trees of class `phylo`, with tips labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{reportMatching}{Logical specifying whether to return the clade
matchings as an attribute of the score.}

\item{bestMatchOnly}{Logical specifying whether to return how informative
each split is about its best match only (`TRUE`) 
or how informative each split is about each other split (`FALSE`).}

\item{splits1, splits2}{Logical matrices where each row corresponds to a terminal,
either listed in the same order or bearing identical names (in any sequence),
and each column corresponds to a bipartition split, such that
each terminal is identified as a member of the ingroup (`TRUE`) or outgroup 
(`FALSE`) of the respective bipartition split.}

\item{partitionQualityIndex}{Output of [SplitPairingInformationIndex] for
`n` taxa; calculated automatically if not specified, but passing a cached
value may improve performance.}
}
\value{
Returns the the mutual phylogenetic information 
content of the optimal matching of bipartitions between two trees, 
following Smith (submitted).
}
\description{
Each partition in a tree can be viewed either as 
- (a) a statement that the 'true' tree is one of those that splits the 
  taxa as specified;
- (b) a statement that the taxa are subdivided into the two groups specified.
}
\details{
The former concept corresponds to the concept of phylogenetic 
information, and views the information content of a pair of partitions
as relating to the proportion of phylogenetic trees that are consistent
with both partitions, giving rise to the
Mutual Arboreal Information similarity measure (`MutualArborealInfo``), and 
the complementary Variation of Arboreal Information distance metric
(`VariationOfArborealInfo`).

The latter sees the information content of a pair of partitions as relating
to the proportion of all possible pairings that are at least as similar
(measured using Meila's (2007) the variation of information) as the pairing
in question, giving rise to the Mutual Clustering Information distance
(`MutualClusterInfo`) and the Variation of Clustering Information similarity
metric (`VariationOfClusterInfo`).

A tree similarity measure is generated by finding an optimal matching that
maximises the total information in common between a partition on one tree
and its pair on a second, considering all possible ways to pair partitions 
between trees (including leaving a partition unpaired).
