\usage{
MutualArborealInfo(tree1, tree2, reportMatching = FALSE)

VariationOfArborealInfo(tree1, tree2, reportMatching = FALSE)

MutualClusteringInfo(tree1, tree2, reportMatching = FALSE,
  bestMatchOnly = TRUE)

MutualArborealInfoSplits(splits1, splits2, reportMatching = FALSE)

MutualPartitionInfoSplits(splits1, splits2, reportMatching = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree1, tree2}{Trees of class `phylo`, with tips labelled identically,
or lists of such trees to undergo pairwise comparison.}

\item{reportMatching}{Logical specifying whether to return the clade
matchings as an attribute of the score.}

\item{splits1, splits2}{Splits [#TODO document properly]}
}
\value{
Returns the the mutual phylogenetic information 
content of the optimal matching of bipartitions between two trees, 
following Smith (submitted).
}
\description{
Each partition in a tree can be viewed either as 
- (a) a statement that the 'true' tree is one of those that splits the 
  taxa as specified;
- (b) a statement that the taxa are subdivided into the two groups specified.
}
\details{
The former concept corresponds to the concept of phylogenetic 
information, and views the information content of a pair of partitions
as relating to the proportion of phylogenetic trees that are consistent
with both partitions, giving rise to the
Mutual Arboreal Information distance (`MutualArborealInfo``).

The latter sees the information content of a pair of partitions as relating
to the proportion of all possible pairings that are at least as similar
(measured using Meila's (2007) the variation of information) as the pairing
in question, giving rise to the Mutual Clustering Information distance
(`MutualClusterInfo`).

A tree similarity metric is generated by finding an optimal matching that
maximises the total information in common between a partition on one tree
and its pair on a second, considering all possible ways to pair partitions 
between trees (including leaving a partition unpaired).
