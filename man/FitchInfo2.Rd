\title{Here we take an approach that is perhaps closer to our original intent.}
\usage{
FitchInfo2(tree, dataset)
}
\description{
Here we take as input a tree topology, a distribution of states, and a
number of steps.
}
\details{
We ask "how many ways are there to produce the observed state frequencies by
placing at most the observed number of steps on the observed tree".

Well, actually, we are asking "what is the probability of seeing at most
the observed number of steps, given the entropy of the observed state
frequencies".

\examples{
tree <- as.phylo(0, 6)
dataset <- MatrixToPhyDat(`rownames<-`(rbind(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3), TipLabels(6)))
FitchInfo2(tree, dataset)
}
