\usage{
SplitMatchProbability(split1, split2)

LnSplitMatchProbability(split1, split2)

\item{split1, split2}{Logical vectors specifying whether each tip belongs in 
group A (`TRUE`) or B (`FALSE`) of the relevant bipartition.}
}
\value{
The probability of observing two splits,
spliting the terminals into bipartitions of the sizes given,
 that match as well as `split1` and `split2` do.
}
