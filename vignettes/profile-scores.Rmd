## Scope of this doucment

This document aims to give a flavour of the justification for using parsimony
in general, and profile parsimony in particular, to reconstruct evolutionary
history; and to summarize the mathematical/information theoretic underpinning
of the profile parsimony approach.

I'll open by acknowledging that a philosophical approach is not everyone's
cup of tea -- it's certainly not my home turf.
I tend to prefer models that can be shown to work well, without worrying too
much about their abstract philosophy -- though admittedly, identifying a
'best' method is not always straightforward [e.g. @Smith2019].

I should also acknowledge that practical considerations can influence the 
choice of reconstruction method: a tip-dated phylogeny cannot be accomplished
in a parsimony framework, for example; and where a principled model of
evolutionary change is available, as with certain subsets of molecular data,
some see a compelling case for using such models to infer phylogeny.

My goal here is not to argue that any method is superior, but to develop a case
that profile parsimony rests on a principled underpinning -- and, if it does
prove to outperform other methods in certain circumstances, to give a sense
of why this might be.


## A philosophy of parsimony

There are a number of complementary perspectives on the philosophical
justificaion for a parsimony approach [e.g. @Farris1983], which this brief
overview will not do justice to;
but hopefully my unqualified and largely unreferenced perspective captures some
of the nature of the principal arguments.
Better-versed readers are invited to suggest improvements or modifications
by e-mail or by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ms609/TreeSearch/issues/new/).

Parsimony has been defended by reference to Occam's Razor: the principle that
scientists should prefer the simplest explanation that can provide an 
adequate account for observed data.
In the context of morphological phylogenetics, "observed data"
are codified as scorings of observed character states in a matrix.
Ideally, a phylogenetic tree would explain the distribution of character states
between taxa by reconstructing each character state as representing a 
homologous feature, with a single evolutionary origin on the tree.
An explanation in which a certain trait evolved once is simpler than one in
which that trait evolved twice; it is less faithful to the information inherent
in the character coding, and attributes less of this information to common
ancestry.
Each additional step on a tree can be viewed as an additional "assumption",
and on a simple or "pure" view, the tree that makes the fewest assumptions
should be preferred.

However, this perspective -- which implicitly underpins the practice of
*equal-weights* parsimony -- treats all assumptions as equivalent;
the simplest hypothesis is the one that makes the fewest assumptions
(here, assumptions of homoplasy).

A more nuanced interpretation of Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest
hypothesis is the one that is least surprising.  A hypothesis predicated
on the existence of a flying spaghetti monster may require only a single (barmy)
assumption, but we might nevertheless tend to prefer a hypothesis that requires
a greater number of assumptions that are better aligned with previous
experience.

### Application of Occam's Razor

This interpretation has two applications for phylogenetics.
The first is that we may wish to prefer trees (which are depictions of 
phylogenetic hypotheses) that concentrate homoplasy in characters that we
believe to be prone to convergent evolution.
This view calls for *character weighting*, that is, assigning less weight
to changes in characters that are believed to be less phylogenetically reliable.
Such characters may be identified by successive approximations [@Farris1969],
by comparing the pattern of their tokens with that of other characters,
by expert judgement, or by other _a priori_ means.

The second application argues that each additional case of homoplasy beyond
the first is successively less surprising: the first observation of homoplasy
(rather than some prior intuition) taught us that the character was not entirely
reliable, making a second homoplasy less unexpected;
the second observed homoplasy, in turn, makes us less surprised by the third.
This approach calls for a *step weighting* approach, in which each
additional step in a given character receives less penalty than the last.
(Mathematically, this can be expressed in as if it were a character weighting
strategy; but I feel that its _a posteriori_ nature conveys a subtly different 
motivation and justifies a separate treatment.)

This raises the question of how each step beyond the first ought to be
penalized.  Ultimately, any concave function (in which each step is penalized
by a positive amount that is smaller than the penalty applied to the previous
step) is consistent with this philosophy [@Arias2004].
The most widely used step weighting approach is Goloboff's [-@Goloboff1993]
implied weighting, where the total cost associated with a character is expressed
as _e_ / (_e_ + _k_), where _e_ is the number of homoplasies within a character,
and _k_ is an arbitrary constant.  As _e_ tends to infinity, this approach tends
to equal weights; as _k_ tends to zero, it tends to clique analysis (in which
a character is either homologous or ignored) [@Farris1983].
The most appropriate value for _k_ may depend on the number of taxa, the number
and distribution of observed states, and other factors
[@Goloboff2008;@Goloboff2018]
(a more detailed treatment  will be provided in a revision of this document).
Moreover, some adjustment must be made for 'missing' data,
i.e. ambiguous tokens, which reduce the opportunity to observe homoplasy
[@Goloboff2014].
Implied weighting is described as an approximation [@Goloboff1993], and I am not
aware of a straightforward interpretation of the 'fit' score, or a principled
definition of the nature of the quantity that is being approximated.


### An information theoretic basis

I argue that the quantity that we should seek to minimise is the "surprise" of
a tree.  Information theory is the science of quantifying unexpectedness.
Information is usually measured in _bits_.  One bit is the amount of information
generated by tossing a fair coin: to record the outcome of a coin toss, I must
record either a `H` or a `T`, and with each of the two symbols equally likely,
there is no way to compress the results of multiple tosses.

The Shannon [-@Shannon1948] information content of an outcome $x$ is defined 
to be $h(x) = -\log_2{P(x)}$, which simplifies to $\log_2{n}$ when all $n$ 
outcomes are equally likely.
Thus, the outcome of a fair coin toss delivers
$\log_2{2} = 1\textrm{ bit}$ of information;
the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die contains
$\log_2{6} \approx 2.58\textrm{ bits}$ of information;
and the outcome of selecting at random one of the 105 unrooted binary six-leaf
trees is $\log_2{105} \approx 6.71\textrm{ bits}$.

Unlikely outcomes are more surprising, and thus contain more information than
likely outcomes.  The information content of rolling a twelve on two fair
six-sided dice is $-\log_2{\frac{1}{36}} \approx 5.16\textrm{ bits}$, whereas a seven,
which could be produced by six of the 36 possible rolls (`1 & 6`, `2 & 5`, ...),
is less surprising, and thus contains less information: 
$-\log_2{\frac{6}{36}} \approx 2.58\textrm{ bits}$.
An additional 2.58 bits of information would be required to establish whether
which of the rolls `1 & 6`, `2 & 5`, ... occurred.

Now consider two competing explanations for an event: (i), three
consecutive rolls of two dice each produced a seven; (ii), two consecutive
rolls of two dice each produced a twelve.
The former event corresponds to  $3 \times 2.58 = 7.75\textrm{ bits}$ of
information, so is less surprising than the latter, which represents
$2 \times 5.16 = 10.34\textrm{ bits}$,
despite involving an additional roll of the dice.

How do we measure the "surprise" associated with additional steps in a character
on a phylogenetic tree?
Consider a character with the states `0 0 0 1 1 1`.
In the most parsimonious situation in which the character contains a single
step on a tree, it is compatible with nine of the 105 labelled six-leaf trees,
and thus represents
$-log_2\frac{9}{105} = 3.54\textrm{ bits}$ of phylogenetic information.
If we are told that the character contains exactly two steps, it can occur on
63 trees, so yields $-log_2\frac{63}{105} = 0.74\textrm{ bits}$.
(The number of trees with _m_ extra steps can be calculated using theorem 1
of @Carter1990, implemented in the function [`Carter1()`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/Carter1.html).)
Learning that a second step occurred meant that 3.54 &minus; 0.74 = 
2.81&nbsp;bits of information we had previously attributed to common ancestry
instead represent a signature of homoplasy; this quantity measures our degree
of 'surprise'.

If we subsequently learn that the character contains three steps, then it can
occur on any six-leaf tree, and contains no phylogenetic information.
We are less surprised by this third step, which attributes the remaining 
0.74 bits of information to factors other than common ancestry, because the
second step had already reduced the amount of phylogenetic information we
expected the character to hold.

## Profile parsimony

Although this is not how the approach was initially justified [@Faith2001],
profile parsimony aims to ascribe as much of the information in each character 
as possible to common ancestry; in the example above, it assigns the first
extra step a penalty of 2.81, and the second extra step a penalty of 0.74,
corresponding to the amount of information that could no longer be assigned
to common ancestry after learning of the existence of the $n$th step.

Whereas the value of a parsimony score obtained under implied weights does not
have any inherent meaning,
the profile parismony score of a given tree represents the amount of information
within a character matrix that can be attributed to common ancestry under
that tree.

Profile parsimony produces a concavity profile that reflects the opportunity
to observe additional steps in each character, unlike implied weighting,
where a single concavity value is applied to all characters, regardless of the
opportunity for additional steps to be observed.

```{r plot-concavities, fig.align="center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE}
e <- 0:15

IWTotal <- function (k) e / (e + k)
IW <- function (k) {
  iwTotal <- IWTotal(k)
  iwStep <- iwTotal[-1] - iwTotal[-length(e)]
  iwStep / max(iwStep)
}
IWPoints <- function (k, n) {
  points(IW(k) ~ e[-1], type = 'b', col = n, pch = 2, lty = 2)
}

plot(e[-1], e[-1], type = 'n', frame.plot = FALSE,
     xlab = 'Extra step',
     ylab = "Relative cost of this extra step",
     ylim = c(0, 1))
k <- c(3, 10, 30)
for (i in seq_along(k)) IWPoints(k[i], i)

PP <- function (a, col, n = 40) {
  char <- rep(0:1, c(a, n - a))
  si <- TreeSearch::StepInformation(char)
  points(I(si / max(si)) ~ I(seq_along(si)), type = 'b', col = col, pch = 1)
}
p <- c(3, 8, 20)
for (i in seq_along(p)) PP(p[i], i + 3)
legend('topright', col = 1:6, lty = c(rep(2, 3), rep(1, 3)),
       pch = c(rep(2, 3), rep(1, 3)),
       bty = 'n', cex = 0.9,
       c(paste0('IW, k = ', k),
         paste0('PP, ', p, ' | ', 40 - p)))


```

The graph shows the profiles under implied weighting (with different concavity
constants) and profile parsimony (under different distributions of the tokens
`0` and `1` in a character coded for forty leaves).
One prominent difference between the character of concavity profiles is that
implied weighting continues to assign relatively large penalties to additional
steps even when the distribution of a character is almost random on a tree.
Another is that profile parsimony treats a second (and each subsequent) step 
as less surprising if there are fewer opportunities to observe a second step by
chance, on account of there being a smaller number of tokens with the rarer
step; implied weighting is blind to the distribution of tokens within a
character.

## Implementation

The present implementation of profile parsimony in "TreeSearch" is restricted:
inapplicable tokens are treated as ambiguous; partial ambiguity (e.g. `{02}`)
is treated as complete (`?`), and informative states (i.e. states present in 
more than one taxon) beyond the first two are ignored (treated as ambiguous).
This reflects the complicated mathematics of calculating the number of trees
with a given number of steps.

Tree length can be calculated with 
[`TreeLength(concavity = 'profile')`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/TreeLength.html),
and tree search performed with 
[`MaximizeParsimony(concavity = 'profile')`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/MaximizeParsimony.html).
Data can be prepared for profile parsimony using [`PrepareDataProfile()`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/PrepareDataProfile.html), and the profile of a character calculated using 
[`StepInformation()`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/StepInformation.html).
