'TreeSearch' is an R package that allows parsimony search on morphological datasets.

## Installation

### Simple installation

To use 'TreeSearch' you will first need to [install R](https://CRAN.R-project.org/).  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) ([overview](https://dss.princeton.edu/training/RStudio101.pdf)) is a popular front-end that makes several of R's features easier to use.

The 'TreeSearch' package can be installed as any other package. 
To get the latest stable version from CRAN, type
```r
install.packages('TreeSearch')
```
into the R (or RStudio) command line.

### For advanced users

To get the latest development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ms609/TreeSearch/), type
```r
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('ms609/TreeSearch')
```

Windows users may need to install 
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) before
installing from the GitHub source.

Once installed, load the 'TreeSearch' package into R using
```r
library('TreeSearch')
```

## What next?

You might want to:

- [Load data](https://ms609.github.io/TreeTools/articles/load-data.html) from a Nexus file or spreadsheet
- Conduct parsimony search using Brazeau, Guillerme & Smith's [approach to inapplicable data](tree-search.html), or using [Profile parsimony](profile.html).
- Conduct parsimony search using [custom optimality criteria](custom.html).
