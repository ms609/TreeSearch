# To integrate into 2.0.0 notes

- New opt-in `MaximizeParsimony(strategy = "intensive")` preset: `"thorough"` plus
  extra Wagner starts for more starting-basin diversity.  On difficult datasets it
  finds shorter trees (a few steps) at neutral-to-lower search cost; never selected
  by `strategy = "auto"`, so choose it explicitly.

- `MaximizeParsimony()` results now carry a `candidates_evaluated` attribute:
  the number of TBR/SPR-class rearrangements examined during a single-threaded
  search (the analogue of TNT's "rearrangements examined"), for diagnosing
  search efficiency.

- New `SearchControl()` option `stallEscalateFactor` (default `1`, disabled):
  when a driven search stalls, escalate ratchet perturbation strength for
  subsequent replicates so the search adapts to a difficult dataset at runtime.

- Faster driven search: per-clip allocation churn in the TBR kernel removed
  (reusable scratch buffers and an open-addressed rerooting-dedup table), and
  the debug-only topology validation no longer runs in release builds.

- Further driven-search speedup: the exact directional insertion edge-set
  computation now reuses caller-owned scratch and skips its per-clip zero-fill
  (under a write-before-read invariant, debug-asserted), saving up to ~16% wall
  on large datasets where the `O(n_node * words)` zero-fill dominated.  Search
  results are bit-identical (score and `candidates_evaluated` unchanged).

- HSJ (Hopkins & St John 2021) scoring is now invariant to the
  arbitrary ordering of a `phyDat` object's `levels`.  Both the primary
  absent/present term and the secondary-character dissimilarity term
  previously depended on the internal token ordering, so the same dataset
  could score differently under different (equivalent) `levels`.

- Hierarchical-scoring helpers renamed to the package's `BigCamelCase`
  convention (the snake_case names are removed): `recode_hierarchy()` ->
  `RecodeHierarchy()`, `hierarchy_from_names()` -> `HierarchyFromNames()`,
  `validate_hierarchy()` -> `ValidateHierarchy()`, `hierarchy_chars()` ->
  `HierarchyChars()`, `hierarchy_controlling()` -> `HierarchyControlling()`.
  The internal C++-bridge helpers (`build_tip_labels()`,
  `hierarchy_to_blocks()`, `non_hierarchy_weights()`, `hsj_absent_state()`)
  are now private and no longer exported.

- `WideSample()` now dispatches to the appropriate Max-Min diversity (MMDP)
  solver from the `MaxMin` package, choosing the tier automatically
  from `length(trees)`.

- New functions `LeastSquaresTree()` and `LeastSquaresFit()` search for, and
  fit branch lengths to, the tree that best matches a target distance matrix
  under a least-squares criterion, reusing the optimised C++ rearrangement
  kernel (NNI + SPR).  Ordinary (`method = "ols"`) and non-negative
  (`method = "nnls"`) least squares are supported, with optional
  Fitch-Margoliash (`weight = "fm"`) or custom weighting.
  `LeastSquaresFit()` mirrors `phangorn::nnls.tree()` but runs in the native
  kernel.


- `attr(dataset, "weight")` now accepts non-integer character weights.  The
  C++ scoring engine still stores `int` weights internally; fractional
  inputs are rescaled to integer with a configurable precision (default
  0.001, controlled by `getOption("TreeSearch.fractional.scale", 1000L)`).
  Previously, fractional weights were silently truncated at the Rcpp
  boundary (e.g. `c(0.5, 1.7)` became `c(0L, 1L)`, dropping 50% / 41% of
  the respective characters' contributions).  Integer weights pass
  through unchanged.  `TreeLength()` and other scores are returned in
  units of `steps * scale` when fractional weights are present; within-
  run ranking is unaffected.

- `LengthAdded()` removes a temporary warning guard that fired on datasets
  triggering the T-302 `qmApp` scalar-unwrap fix; regression tests now cover
  both the `qmApp` (T-302) and `qm` (commit e8b318c3) scalar-unwrap paths,
  confirming all deltas are non-negative and match independent computation.

# TreeSearch 2.0.0

## Breaking changes

- Implied weighting now applies the missing-entries correction of
  Goloboff (2014) by default (`extended_iw = TRUE`).  Characters with
  many missing entries receive a reduced effective concavity, compensating
  for artificially low observed homoplasy.  Set `extended_iw = FALSE` to
  reproduce pre-2.0.0 behaviour.
- `MaximizeParsimony()` has an entirely new parameter interface.
  The previous `MaximizeParsimony()` (R-loop search using MorphyLib) has been
  renamed to `Morphy()`.
  Code that passes Morphy-style parameters (e.g. `ratchIter`, `tbrIter`,
  `maxHits`) to `MaximizeParsimony()` will be automatically forwarded to
  `Morphy()` with a deprecation warning.
  Update your code to call `Morphy()` directly, or adopt the new
  `MaximizeParsimony()` parameters.
  This compatibility shim will be removed in a future release.

## C++ search engine

`MaximizeParsimony()` is rewritten from the ground up with a native C++ search
engine, replacing the R-loop/MorphyLib backend for equal weights, implied
weights, and profile parsimony.  Typical searches are an order of magnitude
faster; inapplicable character handling (Brazeau _et al._ 2019) is built in.

### New features

- `PaintCharacters()` colours each character in a morphological dataset by its
  most concordant tree edges.

- `ScoreSpectrum()`: Chao1-style landscape coverage estimator.  Treats
  distinct parsimony scores found across replicates as "species" and estimates
  how thoroughly the parsimony landscape has been sampled (Good-Turing sample
  coverage, Chao1 richness lower bound, unseen score-level fraction).  The
  Shiny app's confidence panel now displays the coverage estimate when
  sufficient replicates have been completed.  `MaximizeParsimony()` now
  returns a `replicate_scores` attribute containing per-replicate local-optimum
  scores for this purpose.

- **Multi-replicate driven search** pipeline: random Wagner tree → TBR →
  sectorial search (XSS, RSS, CSS) → ratchet → drift → tree fusing →
  final TBR.
- **Parallel search** via `nThreads`: replicates run on independent threads
  with a shared tree pool.
- **Timeout** via `maxSeconds`.
- **User-supplied starting tree**: when a `tree` argument is provided, the
  first replicate begins from that topology; subsequent replicates use
  random Wagner trees.
- **Adaptive strategy presets** via `strategy`: `"auto"` (default) selects
  `"sprint"`, `"default"`, or `"thorough"` based on the number of tips.
  Explicit parameters always override preset values.
- **Profile parsimony** runs natively in C++; no longer delegates to
  `Morphy()`.
- **Topological constraints** enforced natively in C++ (including during
  Wagner tree construction and sectorial search).
- **Per-phase timing** returned as a `timings` attribute on the result.
- **MPT enumeration**: after the main search converges, a TBR plateau walk
  from each pool tree discovers additional most-parsimonious topologies on the
  same and neighbouring score plateaus, up to `poolMaxSize`.
  This addresses a common complaint that the previous implementation returned
  only one tree when multiple MPTs exist.
- `LeastSquaresTree()` and `LeastSquaresFit()` search for, and
  fit branch lengths to, the tree that best matches a target distance matrix
  under a least-squares criterion, reusing the optimised C++ rearrangement
  kernel (NNI + SPR).  Ordinary (`method = "ols"`) and non-negative
  (`method = "nnls"`) least squares are supported, with optional
  Fitch-Margoliash (`weight = "fm"`) or custom weighting.  This provides the
  topology-search step of Lapointe & Cucumel's (1997) average consensus
  procedure; `LeastSquaresFit()` mirrors `phangorn::nnls.tree()` but runs in
  the native kernel.
- `PaintCharacters()` colours each character in a morphological
  dataset by the hue of the tree edges it most concordantly supports, using
  `ConcordanceTable()` MI weights averaged in CIELAB colour space.  Pairs with
  `TreeTools::PaintTree()` to visually map characters to clades.
- `attr(dataset, "weight")` now accepts non-integer character weights.  The
  C++ scoring engine still stores `int` weights internally; fractional
  inputs are rescaled to integer with a configurable precision (default
  0.001, controlled by `getOption("TreeSearch.fractional.scale", 1000L)`).
  Previously, fractional weights were silently truncated at the Rcpp
  boundary (e.g. `c(0.5, 1.7)` became `c(0L, 1L)`, dropping 50% / 41% of
  the respective characters' contributions).  Integer weights pass
  through unchanged.  `TreeLength()` and other scores are returned in
  units of `steps * scale` when fractional weights are present; within-
  run ranking is unaffected.

### New parameters for `MaximizeParsimony()`

- `strategy` — `"auto"` (default), `"sprint"`, `"default"`, `"thorough"`,
  or `"none"`.
- `nThreads` — number of parallel worker threads (default 1).
- `maxSeconds` — wall-clock timeout (0 = no limit).
- `sprFirst` — run SPR before TBR in each replicate.
- `ratchetPerturbMode`, `ratchetPerturbMaxMoves`, `ratchetAdaptive` —
  configure ratchet perturbation (zero-weight, up-weight, mixed, adaptive).
- `driftCycles`, `driftAfdLimit`, `driftRfdLimit` — drift search parameters.
- `xssRounds`, `xssPartitions`, `rssRounds`, `cssRounds`, `cssPartitions`,
  `sectorMinSize`, `sectorMaxSize` — sectorial search parameters.
- `fuseInterval`, `fuseAcceptEqual` — tree fusing parameters.
- `poolMaxSize`, `poolSuboptimal` — tree pool management.
- `tbrMaxHits`, `wagnerStarts`, `tabuSize`.
- `nniFirst` — NNI warmup pass before SPR/TBR in each replicate; at
  ≥100 tips this substantially improves the Wagner starting-tree quality
  at negligible cost for small datasets.
- `postRatchetSectorial` — run a second XSS+RSS+CSS pass after ratchet
  perturbation; approximates TNT's interleaved sectorial pattern.
  Enabled by default in the `"thorough"` preset.
- `outerCycles`, `maxOuterResets` — repeat the full
  \[XSS/RSS/CSS → ratchet → NNI-perturbation → drift → TBR\] sequence
  _n_ times per replicate; budget is divided evenly.  Enabled in the
  `"thorough"` preset (`outerCycles = 2`).
- `wagnerBias`, `wagnerBiasTemp` — bias taxon addition order during Wagner
  tree construction toward taxa with more informative characters
  (Goloboff 2014), substantially improving starting-tree quality at large
  tip counts.
- `perturbStopFactor` — stop after `nTip × perturbStopFactor` consecutive
  replicates that fail to improve the best score; provides 2–7× speedup on
  converged searches at no score cost.
- `pruneReinsertCycles`, `pruneReinsertDrop`, `pruneReinsertSelection` —
  taxon pruning-reinsertion perturbation: drop a fraction of leaves, let
  the backbone re-optimise with TBR, then reinsert taxa greedily.
  Complementary to the ratchet (which perturbs character weights).
- `nniPerturbCycles`, `nniPerturbFraction` — stochastic NNI-perturbation:
  randomly apply NNI swaps to a fraction of internal branches and
  reconverge, escaping local optima without altering character weights.
- `annealCycles`, `annealPhases`, `annealTStart`, `annealTEnd`,
  `annealMovesPerPhase` — multi-cycle PCSA (simulated annealing
  perturbation) phase.
- `adaptiveLevel` — dynamically scale ratchet and drift effort per
  replicate based on the observed hit rate.
- `adaptiveStart` — Thompson-sampling bandit strategy for starting-tree
  selection; adapts over replicates to which strategies yield best scores.
- `enumTimeFraction` — fraction of `maxSeconds` reserved for the MPT
  plateau enumeration walk at the end of the search (default 10%).
- `intraFuse` — within-replicate tree fusing against pool donors after TBR
  polish; approximates TNT's within-replicate fusing pattern.
- `ratchetTaper` — gradually reduce ratchet perturbation probability as
  the pool stabilises, allowing finer local exploration late in the search.
- `consensusConstrain` — lock pool-consensus splits as topological
  constraints for subsequent replicates.
- `consensusStableReps` — stop when the strict consensus is unchanged for
  this many consecutive replicates (0 = disabled; set e.g. 3 to enable).
- `progressCallback` — R function called after each replicate (for custom
  progress reporting).

### Search output

- **Convergence summary**: when `verbosity > 0` (the default),
  `MaximizeParsimony()` now prints a one-line summary on exit reporting the
  best score, number of replicates completed, replicates since last
  improvement, number of distinct MPTs found, stop reason (time limit,
  target hits, perturbation-stop, or user interrupt), and elapsed time.
  The same information is available as named attributes on the returned
  tree list.

### Search optimizations

- **Collapsed-edge clip skipping**: TBR, SPR, and drift search skip
  clips at zero-length edges that provably cannot improve the score,
  reducing unnecessary evaluations on sparse data.
- **Conflict-guided sectorial search**: random sectorial search targets
  sectors around splits that conflict across pool trees.
- **Diversity-aware pool eviction**: when the tree pool is full, the most
  topologically similar entry is evicted to maintain diversity.
- **Cross-replicate consensus constraint tightening**: opt-in via
  `consensusConstrain = TRUE` in `SearchControl()`.
- **Consensus-stability early stopping**: when `consensusStableReps > 0` in
  `SearchControl()`, search stops when the strict consensus of best-score
  pool trees has been unchanged for that many consecutive replicates.
  Disabled by default.

### Batch resampling

- `Resample()` gains `nReplicates` and `nThreads` parameters for batch and
  parallel jackknife/bootstrap resampling via a single C++ call.
- `SuccessiveApproximations()` gains `concavity` and `constraint` parameters.

## Profile parsimony: multi-state support

- Profile parsimony now supports characters with up to 5 informative states
  (previously limited to 2).  Characters with 3--5 states use the recursive
  algorithm of Maddison & Slatkin (1991).
- New C++ function `MaddisonSlatkin()` computes the number of labelled
  histories for multi-state characters.

## Data simulation

- New function `ParsSim()` simulates morphological datasets under a parsimony
  model (equal weights, implied weights, or profile parsimony).  Each
  character starts at minimum steps; extra steps are placed one at a time,
  verified to increase the Fitch score by exactly 1.

## Scoring

- `TreeLength()` and `CharacterLength()` / `FastCharacterLength()` use the
  C++ engine for all scoring modes (equal weights, implied weights, profile
  parsimony).

## Function rename

- `TaxonInfluence()` now uses `MaximizeParsimony()` internally.
- `AdditionTree()` now uses the C++ Wagner tree engine, with native support
  for implied weights, profile parsimony, and constraints.

## Bug fixes

- `LengthAdded()` no longer errors on datasets whose contrast matrix contains
  zero-sum rows for tokens that are declared in the SYMBOLS list but not used
  by any taxon in the character being scored (#294).

- `LengthAdded()` no longer returns negative values when multiple rows of the
  contrast matrix satisfy the fully-ambiguous applicable condition (e.g.
  datasets with ~19 taxa and certain character structures); the first matching
  row is now used consistently (#302).

- Shiny: scoring error notification now shows the actual error message
  (e.g. "Trees have different numbers of edges") rather than the generic
  "Could not score all trees with dataset".
- Shiny: fix search requiring two clicks to start when trees have mixed
  topologies (polytomous/binary).  The "Search" shortcut button now appears
  only after the modal is dismissed via its own Search button, so it is never
  obscured by the modal backdrop.
- Fix output trees from `MaximizeParsimony()` having invalid preorder
  numbering (affected `DropTip()`, distance calculations, and plotting).
- Fix `fuseInterval = 0` causing a crash (division by zero).
- Fix `is_uninformative()` misclassifying ambiguous characters as
  uninformative.
- Fix `compute_fixed_steps()` undercount for all-ambiguous characters.
- Fix IW scoring with missing `min_steps` offset.
- Fix crash when dataset contains only ambiguous (`?`) tokens.

## Custom search functions

- `Ratchet()`, `MultiRatchet()`, `Jackknife()`, `MorphyBootstrap()`, and
  `TreeSearch()` are no longer deprecated.  These functions support pluggable
  `TreeScorer` and `EdgeSwapper` functions for custom scoring strategies;
  for standard parsimony, use `MaximizeParsimony()`.

## App improvements (`EasyTrees()`)

- **Async search**: the session remains responsive while a search is running.
- **Parallel search**: the search settings modal includes a thread count slider
  (when multiple cores are available).
- **Tree accumulation**: repeated "Continue search" runs accumulate trees at
  the same optimal score, with de-duplication by topology.
- **Search confidence**: after each search, the results pane shows the hit rate
  and an estimate of the replicates needed for 95% confidence.
- **Search config modal** reorganized into labelled sections (step weighting,
  parallelization, search intensity, results to keep).
- Fix `PlotCharacter()` crash on multifurcating consensus trees.
- Fix first search not appearing to update trees in memory.
- Clarified "Stop after best score found N times" slider label with help text.
- Dataset-adaptive timeout default (1–15 minutes based on dataset size).
- Internal modularization of the Shiny app into proper Shiny modules.
