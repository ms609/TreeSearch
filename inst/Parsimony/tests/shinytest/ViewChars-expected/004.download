# This log was generated procedurally to facilitate the reproduction of
# figures obtained during an interactive Shiny session.
# It is provided without guarantee of completeness or accuracy.
# In particular, code will not be logged when previously computed values
# are retrieved from cache.
# 
# Before running, check that the script and any data files are in the
# R working directory, which can be read with getwd() and set with setwd().
# 
# Please validate the code before reproducing in a manuscript, reporting
# any errors at https://github.com/ms609/treesearch/issues or by e-mail to
# the package maintainer.
