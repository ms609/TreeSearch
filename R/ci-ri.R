#' Consistency / retention 'indices'
#' 
#' `Consistency()` calculates the so-called consistency and retention 'indices'
#' for each character in a dataset, given a bifurcating tree.
#' Although there is not a straightforward interpretation of these indices,
#' they are sometimes taken as an indicator of the fit of a character to a 
#' tree.  Values correlate with the number of species sampled and the 
#' distribution of taxa between character states, so are not strictly comparable
#' between characters in which these factors differ.

#' #TODO: Retention index not yet implemented.

#' retention index (ri), and rescaled consistency index (rc).
