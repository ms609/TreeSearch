"TreeSearch" is an R package that contains a "shiny" user interface for 
interactive tree search and exploration of results, including character
visualization,
[rogue taxon detection](https://ms609.github.io/Rogue),
[tree space mapping](https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/articles/treespace.html),
and cluster consensus trees.

Inapplicable character states are handled using the algorithm of Brazeau,
Guillerme and Smith (2019) using the "Morphy" C library (Brazeau _et al_. 2017).
Implied weighting (Goloboff, 1993),
Profile Parsimony (Faith and Trueman, 2001)
and Successive Approximations (Farris, 1969)
are implemented; 
[custom optimality criteria](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/custom.html)
and search approaches can also be defined.


# Installation

Full installation instructions, including notes on installing R, are available
in a [vignette](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/getting-started.html).

Install and load the stable version from CRAN as follows:

```r
install.packages("TreeSearch")
library("TreeSearch")
```

Some features of the GUI require versions of packages scheduled for release to
CRAN in late 2021.  Until then, you can install them using:
```r
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
if (packageVersion("ape" < "5.5.2")) 
  remotes::install_github("emmanuelparadis/ape")
if (packageVersion("TreeTools") < "1.5.1.9100")
  remotes::install_github("ms609/TreeTools")
if (packageVersion("TreeDist") <= "2.0.3")
  remotes::install_github("ms609/TreeTools")
if (packageVersion("Rogue") <= "2.0.0")
  remotes::install_github("ms609/Rogue")
```

Install and load the development version of "TreeSearch" with:

```r
remotes::install_github("ms609/TreeSearch")
library("TreeSearch")
```

# Quick start

Launch a graphical user interface (development version only)
by typing `TreeSearch::EasyTrees()` in the R console.
