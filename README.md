"TreeSearch" (Smith 2022c) is an R package that contains a "shiny" user interface for 
interactive tree search and exploration of results, including character
visualization,
[rogue taxon detection](https://ms609.github.io/Rogue) (Smith 2022a),
[tree space mapping](https://ms609.github.io/TreeDist/articles/treespace.html)
(Smith 2022b),
and cluster consensus trees.

Inapplicable character states are handled using the algorithm of Brazeau,
Guillerme and Smith (2019) using the "Morphy" C library (Brazeau _et al_. 2017).
Implied weighting (Goloboff, 1993),
Profile Parsimony (Faith and Trueman, 2001)
and Successive Approximations (Farris, 1969)
are implemented; 
[custom optimality criteria](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/custom.html)
and search approaches can also be defined.


# Installing in R

Full installation instructions, including notes on installing R, are available
in a [vignette](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/getting-started.html).

Install and load the stable version from CRAN as follows:

```r
install.packages("TreeSearch")
library("TreeSearch")
```

Install and load the development version of "TreeSearch" with:

```r
if(!require("curl")) install.packages("curl")
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ms609/TreeSearch")
library("TreeSearch")
```

# Installing stand-alone application

The TreeSearch user interface can be run as a stand-alone application without
installing R.
[Download](https://github.com/ms609/TreeSearch/releases) the latest release for your platform.
If your preferred platform is not supported, please contact the maintainer.

## Installation on Windows

You may need to obtain the [ffmpeg library](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ffmpeg)
before you can run TreeSearch.

This is best installed using ['Chocolatey'](https://chocolatey.org/).

Once chocolatey is installed, open a PowerShell window with administrative privileges, and
type `choco install ffmpeg`; then restart your computer.


# Quick start

Launch a graphical user interface by typing `TreeSearch::EasyTrees()` in the R console.

For more control over search settings, see [`?MaximizeParsimony()`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/MaximizeParsimony.html).
