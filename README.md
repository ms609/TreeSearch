# TreeSearch
This package exists to allow parsimony-style tree searches in R.

It extends the basic functionality available in phangorn, with a view to making tree search faster and more efficient, 
and allowing user-defined optimality criteria to be employed.

Implied weighting and heuristic searches such as the Parsimony Ratchet are implemented (function: `Ratchet`).
Browse the vignettes (with `vignette(package = "TreeSearch")` to get started.

# Installation

Install and load the library from CRAN as follows:
```
install.packages('TreeSearch')
library('TreeSearch')
```

If you're feeling brave, you can install the development version thus:
```r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('ms609/TreeSearch')
```


# Optimailty criteria

TreeSearch allows the implementation of various optimality criteria, including
- The Profile Parsimony approach introduced by Faith and Trueman (2001).
- Successive Approximations weighting (Farris 1969).
- Fitch parsimony with inapplicable data (Brazeau, Guillerme and Smith, 2017).

It is also possible to specify bespoke optimality criteria.
