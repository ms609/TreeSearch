# Calculate parsimony score from Morphy object

This function must be passed a valid Morphy object, or R may crash. For
most users, the function
[`TreeLength()`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/TreeLength.md)
will be more appropriate.

## Usage

``` r
MorphyTreeLength(tree, morphyObj)

MorphyLength(
  parent,
  child,
  morphyObj,
  inPostorder = FALSE,
  nTaxa = mpl_get_numtaxa(morphyObj)
)

GetMorphyLength(parentOf, leftChild, rightChild, morphyObj)

C_MorphyLength(parentOf, leftChild, rightChild, morphyObj)
```

## Arguments

- tree:

  A tree of class [`phylo`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ape/man/read.tree.html),
  with tip labels in the order generated by
  [`RenumberTips`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeTools/reference/RenumberTips.html),
  i.e. corresponding to the sequence of taxa in the corresponding Morphy
  object.

- morphyObj:

  Object of class `morphy`, perhaps created with
  [`PhyDat2Morphy()`](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/reference/PhyDat2Morphy.md).

- parent:

  Integer vector corresponding to the first column of the edge matrix of
  a tree of class [`phylo`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ape/man/read.tree.html),
  i.e. `tree[["edge"]][, 1]`

- child:

  Integer vector corresponding to the second column of the edge matrix
  of a tree of class
  [`phylo`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ape/man/read.tree.html), i.e.
  `tree[["edge"]][, 2]`.

- parentOf:

  For each node, numbered in postorder, the number of its parent node.

- leftChild:

  For each internal node, numbered in postorder, the number of its left
  child node or tip.

- rightChild:

  For each internal node, numbered in postorder, the number of its right
  child node or tip.

## Value

`MorphyTreeLength()` returns the length of the tree, after applying
weighting.

## Functions

- `MorphyLength()`: Faster function that requires internal tree
  parameters. Node numbering must increase monotonically away from root.

- `GetMorphyLength()`: Fastest function that requires internal tree
  parameters

- `C_MorphyLength()`: Direct call to C function. Use with caution.
